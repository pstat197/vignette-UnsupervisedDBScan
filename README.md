# Project Brainstorming
We will be brainstorming the specific prompt & the relevant tasks for our project.

## 1. What structure exists in this dataset, and how well can we predict an important outcome using both unsupervised (DBSCAN, K-means) and supervised (logistic regression, XGBoost) methods?
For this potential topic, the skeleton can be roughly divided into four sections (and so each of us may pick one if we decided to go forward):

- **Section 1: Data / Feature Exploration and transition to unsupervised clustering**. Conduct exploratory data analysis (identify key features for clustering and prediction) and conduct DBSCAN.
- **Section 2: Unsupervised Clustering**. Run K-means, compare DBSCAN and K-means, visualize clusters.
- **Section 3: Supervised Prediction**. Build logistic regression and XGBoost classifiers. Report accuracy.
- **Section 4: Integration & Comparison**. Conduct cluster-to-target analysis and combine the findings.

The above proposed tasks are not independent (but I've made sure that each person is able to meaningfully participate), so one person may need to wait for another to finish their task in order to proceed. Alternatively, we can also split the task into four independent sections, to which each of us can work independently.
